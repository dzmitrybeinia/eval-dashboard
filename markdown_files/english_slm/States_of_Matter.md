# Lesson name: Understanding the States of Matter

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Solids have a definite shape that does not change.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
In solids, particles are closely packed together, vibrating in place, which gives solids a fixed shape and volume, differentiating them from liquids and gases.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** Gases have particles that are tightly packed and vibrate in place, much like solids.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
This statement is false because it contradicts the properties of gases. Unlike solids, where particles are tightly packed and vibrate in place, gas particles are free-moving and spread out to fill the entire volume of their container.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** When ice is left at room temperature, it will eventually turn into water.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
Water molecules in ice gain energy from the surrounding environment, increasing their movement until they overcome the forces holding them in a solid structure, transitioning to a liquid state.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** Helium in balloons is an example of a solid state.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Helium gas is used in balloons because it's lighter than air, making it rise. This property is characteristic of gases, not solids. In its natural state, helium is a gas, and it only becomes a solid under extreme conditions not typically found in everyday environments.


## Question 5: YesNo

**Statement:** Plasma is a state of matter that is denser than solids due to its high energy levels.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Plasma, unlike solids, is not denser but rather less dense than gases, as it is a highly energized ionized state. Its particles are free from a fixed position, allowing them to move independently, which is why plasma can expand and fill a container more than a gas can.
