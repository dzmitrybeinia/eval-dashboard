      "description": "The original sentence uses 'wie' to introduce examples, which is less formal and can be ambiguous in German. The phrase 'zum Beispiel' is preferred for listing examples in educational texts. Additionally, 'Untersuchung von Klimawandel' should be 'Untersuchung des Klimawandels' to use the correct genitive case, which is more precise and standard in German scientific writing. This correction improves both style and grammatical accuracy.",
