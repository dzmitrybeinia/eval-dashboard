# Lesson name: Introduction to Drawing Techniques: Understanding Line, Shape, and Texture to Create Art

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Crosshatching is used to create an illusion of light and shadow in a drawing.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
Crosshatching is a technique where lines are drawn over each other to build up a texture that mimics the way light interacts with surfaces, creating a sense of depth and volume in the artwork.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** Geometric shapes are limited to circles and squares, while organic shapes are always irregular and freeform.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Geometric shapes encompass a variety of forms including, but not limited to, circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles. Organic shapes are indeed freeform and can vary widely, but they are not exclusively irregular; they can also include elements of geometric shapes while still maintaining a natural appearance.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** Stippling can only be used to create the smoothness of surfaces like glass or water.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Stippling, which is a technique of creating patterns with dots, is actually used to suggest roughness or softness, not smoothness. It's a method to add visual texture and can represent various surfaces, not limited to smooth ones.
