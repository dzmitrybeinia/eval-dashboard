      "description": "The phrase 'caras ou coroas' is not the standard way to refer to the coin toss game in Brazilian Portuguese. The correct and widely accepted term is 'cara ou coroa'. Using the plural form is unnatural and may confuse learners, as the game is always referred to in the singular. This affects both terminology consistency and cultural appropriateness.",

      "correction": "baralho",
      "description": "The term 'baralho de cartas' is redundant in Brazilian Portuguese, as 'baralho' already means 'deck of cards'. The addition of 'de cartas' is unnecessary and not idiomatic. For naturalness and professional usage, 'baralho' should be used alone.",

      "description": "In lists, Brazilian Portuguese conventionally uses 'e' before the last item ('copas, espadas, ouros e paus') for clarity and naturalness. Omitting the conjunction is less natural and may affect readability, especially in educational contexts.",
