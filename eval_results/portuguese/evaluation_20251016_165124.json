The more common term is 'limerique' (with a 'q'), but even this is rare and may confuse learners. For educational clarity and lexical precision, it is better to explain the form as 'poema limerique' or 'poema limerick', and clarify its origin. This addresses both lexical precision and localization, but the primary issue is lexical.",
