      "original": "In Python, a variable named 'temperature' is expected to hold a number representing a measurement like degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, not a string. Attempting to assign a string to 'temperature' would result in a TypeError since Python is trying to interpret 'Hello' as a numerical value.",
      "correction": "In Python, a variable named 'temperature' can hold any type of value, including a string. Assigning a string to 'temperature' does not result in a TypeError, because Python does not enforce variable types.",
      "description": "Incorrect word choice and misleading explanation: Python does not expect variables to hold specific types, and assigning a string does not cause a TypeError.",
