      "description": "The phrase 'Son de Reverde' is a lexical error and does not correspond to any known speech or concept related to Martin Luther King Jr. The intended reference is to his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech, which in Spanish is commonly referred to as 'Sueño de Martin Luther King' or 'Tengo un sueño'. This error affects comprehension and accuracy, as it misrepresents a key historical event and could confuse learners.",
