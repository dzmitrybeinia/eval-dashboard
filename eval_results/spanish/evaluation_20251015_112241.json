      "description": "The use of the star emoji in educational content for Spain may be considered informal and potentially distracting in a formal learning context. For Spanish educational materials, especially for older students or formal settings, it is preferable to avoid emojis unless the target audience is young children and the tone is intentionally playful. Removing the emoji would enhance professionalism and align with standard educational style conventions.",

      "description": "Both questions correctly use opening and closing question marks, and the accent marks are properly placed. No linguistic errors are present. However, ensure that this punctuation style is consistently applied throughout the content, as Spanish requires opening and closing question marks for all interrogative sentences.",
