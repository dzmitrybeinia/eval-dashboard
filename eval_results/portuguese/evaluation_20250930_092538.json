      "description": "The phrase 'fogos de artifício em agulhas' is culturally inaccurate and misleading, as 'agulhas' (needles) are not associated with Chinese New Year celebrations. The correct description should simply mention 'fogos de artifício' (fireworks), which are a traditional part of the festivities. This correction ensures cultural appropriateness and clarity.",

      "description": "The term 'Dia de Ação de Graças' is a direct translation of 'Thanksgiving' and is not commonly used in Brazilian Portuguese outside educational or religious contexts. For a Brazilian audience, it is more natural to refer to the holiday by its English name 'Thanksgiving' when discussing American traditions, or to provide a brief explanation. This improves cultural clarity and avoids confusion.",
