# Lesson name: The Science of Space Travel

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Ion propulsion systems are the most efficient method for short-distance space travel.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
While ion propulsion is highly efficient, it is actually more suitable for long-duration missions due to its slow acceleration. For shorter distances, chemical rockets are generally preferred because of their faster thrust generation.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** The main purpose of life support systems in a spacecraft is to provide a comfortable living environment for astronauts.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Life support systems in spacecraft are critical for maintaining a safe and habitable environment by providing essential life-sustaining elements like oxygen and water, not necessarily comfort, which is a secondary concern.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** The technology required for interstellar travel is already fully developed and ready for immediate implementation.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Technological readiness for interstellar travel is still in the development phase, with significant challenges remaining in propulsion systems, radiation shielding, and communication. Continuous advancements are necessary to overcome the vast distances and other obstacles implied by the theme.
