      "description": "The sentence incorrectly defines 'hypotheses' as random guesses and states they are 'opposite to what is expected.' In scientific context, hypotheses are informed predictions, not random guesses, and they are not necessarily opposite to expectations. This could mislead learners about the nature of hypotheses.",
