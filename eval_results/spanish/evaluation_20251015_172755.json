      "description": "The term 'autos' is more commonly used in Latin American Spanish, while 'coches' is the standard term in Spain. Using 'coches' ensures regional appropriateness and maintains consistency with Peninsular Spanish norms. This is a minor localization issue affecting terminology, but since the rest of the sentence is linguistically correct, the primary category is localization.",

For improved localization, consider mentioning a broader range of examples or adding a note about other assistants relevant to the Spanish market.",

This is a minor localization issue related to the inclusion of regionally popular services.",
