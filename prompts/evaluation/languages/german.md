Focus on objective German linguistic rules.

## SPECIFIC LINGUISTIC CHECKPOINTS

### Grammar & Morphology
- **Cases (Kasus)**: Verify the correct use of Nominative, Accusative, Dative, and Genitive for articles, nouns, and adjectives. Pay close attention to prepositions that govern specific cases.
- **Gender Agreement (Genus)**: Ensure all articles (`der`, `die`, `das`) and adjective endings correctly match the gender of the noun.
- **Verb Position (Satzbau)**: Check that the verb is in the second position in main clauses and at the end of subordinate clauses (e.g., after `dass`, `weil`, `ob`).
- **Verb Forms**: Ensure correct conjugation for strong and weak verbs, and the proper use of `haben` or `sein` as auxiliary verbs in the Perfekt tense.

### Spelling & Orthography
- **Noun Capitalization**: All nouns **must** be capitalized. Verify this rule is followed without exception.
- **Umlauts and Eszett**: Check for the correct use of umlauts (`ä`, `ö`, `ü`) and the Eszett (`ß`) versus `ss` (e.g., after long vs. short vowels).
- **Compound Nouns (Komposita)**: Ensure compound words are written as a single unit without incorrect spaces (e.g., `Haustür`, not `Haus Tür`).
