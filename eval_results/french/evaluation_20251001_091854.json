      "description": "The phrase 'faire s'étouffer le patient' is a lexical error, as it means 'to make the patient choke,' which is the opposite of the intended meaning. The correct verb is 'faire tousser' (to make cough), which accurately describes the recommended action in a choking situation. This error could lead to dangerous misunderstanding.",

      "description": "While 'manœuvre de Heimlich' is widely recognized in French, in some official French first aid contexts, the term 'compression abdominale' is preferred for clarity and to avoid anglicism. However, since 'manœuvre de Heimlich' is commonly understood, this is a minor localization note for consistency with local first aid terminology.",
