      "description": "The use of hyphens to separate numbers (as in '123-456-789') is not standard in German educational contexts. In German, numbers are typically grouped with spaces or sometimes periods, especially for phone numbers or long digit sequences. Using hyphens may confuse learners or seem unnatural. The recommended format is to use spaces: '123 456 789'.",

For broader accessibility and naturalness, 'GedÃ¤chtnistechniken' is preferred in educational materials, unless specifically discussing mnemonic devices as a subset.",

      "description": "The mnemonic sentence 'Mein Vater erklÃ¤rt mir jeden Samstag unsere neun Planeten' refers to the traditional list of nine planets, which is outdated since Pluto is no longer officially classified as a planet in the solar system. Additionally, the original mnemonic uses 'Samstag', but the more common version in German uses 'Sonntag'. For current educational accuracy and cultural relevance, update the mnemonic to reflect the current planetary count or clarify the historical context.",

If the lesson is intended for a formal setting, it is better to omit the emoji.",
