      "description": "The reference to the famous speech is given as \"Tengo un sueÃ±o\", which is the Spanish translation of \"I Have a Dream\". In Spanish educational contexts, it is more culturally appropriate and academically standard to cite the original title in English, especially when referring to well-known international speeches. This helps students recognize the speech in its original context and facilitates further research. The correction is to use \"I Have a Dream\" de Martin Luther King Jr.",
