      "description": "The term 'Civil Rights Act de 1964' mixes English and French, which is not standard in French educational content. The correct localized term is 'Loi sur les droits civiques de 1964', which is both accurate and natural for French-speaking audiences. Using the English term disrupts the flow and may confuse learners unfamiliar with the original English name.",

      "description": "The phrase 'Voting Rights Act de 1965' is a direct borrowing from English and does not follow French localization standards. The appropriate translation is 'Loi sur le droit de vote de 1965', which is the established term in French for this legislation. Using the English name may hinder comprehension and is not culturally appropriate in a French educational context.",

      "description": "The word 'auto-défense' should be written as 'autodéfense' without a hyphen, according to standard French orthography for compound nouns. This is a spelling and grammar issue that affects the correctness of the text.",

      "description": "The acronym 'SNCC' is used without explanation. In French educational content, it is best practice to provide the full English name at least once for clarity, especially since the organization is not widely known in Francophone contexts. This ensures learners understand the reference.",
