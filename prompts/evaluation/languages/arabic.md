# LANGUAGE FOCUS: Arabic (العربية)

## ARABIC-SPECIFIC EVALUATION CRITERIA

### Script and Orthography
- **Right-to-Left Script**: Ensure full RTL compliance, including punctuation mirroring when required
- **Letter Forms**: Verify correct contextual forms (initial, medial, final, isolated) especially with diacritics
- **Diacritics (Tashkīl)**: Only include when pedagogically necessary; partial vocalization should remain consistent
- **Hamza Placement**: Check the seat of hamza (أ، إ، ؤ، ئ، ء) according to surrounding vowels and consonants
- **Arabic vs. Arabic-Indic Digits**: Use one system consistently based on regional norms

### Morphology and Grammar
- **Verb Conjugation**: Confirm agreement in person, gender, and number across perfect (الماضي) and imperfect (المضارع) tenses
- **Dual Forms**: Validate correct usage of the dual in nouns, adjectives, and verbs where applicable
- **Case Endings (الإعراب)**: In formal Modern Standard Arabic, nominative/accusative/genitive endings should be accurate when vocalized
- **Pronoun Attachment**: Verify proper attachment of object pronouns and possessive suffixes
- **Negation Patterns**: Ensure correct negation particles (لا، لم، لن، ما) with compatible verb forms

### Syntax and Word Order
- **VSO vs. SVO**: Both orders exist; ensure the chosen order preserves emphasis and clarity
- **Idāfa Constructions**: Check noun-noun relationships for correct order and definiteness
- **Relative Clauses**: Confirm use of appropriate relative pronouns (الذي، التي، الذين...) and agreement
- **Sentence Cohesion**: Maintain logical connectors (و، ثم، أو، لكن) to guide flow without overuse

### Lexical and Semantic Issues
- **Register**: Favor Modern Standard Arabic; avoid colloquialisms unless intentionally highlighted
- **Loanwords**: Prefer established Arabic equivalents; if transliterated, ensure recognized spelling
- **Polysemy**: Watch for words with multiple meanings (e.g., علم) and confirm context fits the intended sense
- **Terminology**: Ensure subject-specific terms align with educational standards in the Arab world

### Cultural and Localization Aspects
- **Regional Neutrality**: Content should be broadly accessible across Arabic-speaking regions
- **Examples and Names**: Use culturally appropriate references; avoid region-specific idioms without explanation
- **Date and Formatting**: DMY order is standard; use Hijri references only if contextually relevant
- **Measurement Units**: Metric system is default; include imperial equivalents only if necessary for context

### Common Error Patterns to Check
- **Confusion Between تاء مربوطة and هاء**: Ensure ة/ه distinction in feminine endings
- **Misplaced Alif Maqsura/Yāʼ**: Validate usage of ى vs. ي at word endings
- **Tanwīn Handling**: When vocalized, confirm correct nunation marks (ً ٍ ٌ)
- **Plural Forms**: Double-check broken plurals and sound plural endings for gender/number agreement
- **Punctuation Direction**: Commas and question marks should mirror RTL usage (، ؟)

## EVALUATION SUBCATEGORIES

### Linguistic Issues:
- **Grammar**: Verb agreement, case endings, pronoun attachment
- **Orthography**: Script direction, diacritics, hamza placement
- **Lexical**: Register consistency, terminology accuracy, false friends
- **Morphology**: Dual forms, plural patterns, word derivation errors

### Localization Issues:
- **Cultural Relevance**: Examples or references unsuitable for Arabic-speaking learners
- **Regional Bias**: Overly dialectal expressions without clarification
- **Formatting**: Western numerals or punctuation breaking RTL readability
- **Borrowings**: Poor adaptation of foreign terms to Arabic phonology

### Content Alignment Issues:
- **Educational Standards**: Concepts diverging from accepted curricula in Arabic-speaking countries
- **Clarity**: Complex sentences that hinder comprehension in MSA context
- **Terminology Consistency**: Mixed usage of Arabic and foreign equivalents within the same topic
- **Age Appropriateness**: Language register too advanced or simplistic for the intended grade

Focus on errors that impact comprehension, accuracy, or cultural suitability for Arabic-speaking learners.
