However, for educational content, it is preferable to use the adapted form 'post-its' (with hyphen and plural 's'), which is accepted, but consider the alternative 'notas adesivas' for greater localization and clarity. No orthographic error is present, but the use of the English term may be less clear for some audiences.",

While emojis can increase engagement, their use should be consistent with the tone and formality of the lesson. Consider removing the emoji or replacing it with a more formal expression if the target audience is older or the context is professional.",
