However, for educational clarity, especially for beginners or younger audiences, it is recommended to spell out the full term at least once before using the abbreviation. This ensures comprehension and aligns with best practices in Spanish-language educational materials.",

      "description": "The phrase 'paros cardíacos' is used correctly in terms of spelling and accentuation. However, in Spanish medical terminology, the singular 'paro cardíaco' is more commonly used when referring to the condition in general, unless specifically discussing multiple cases. If the intent is to refer to the general concept, consider using the singular form for greater lexical precision and naturalness.",

      "description": "The phrase uses the imperative form 'Solicita,' which is appropriate for direct instructions. However, in some Spanish-speaking regions, a more neutral or less direct form such as 'Debes solicitar ayuda médica profesional de inmediato' may be preferred for educational materials to soften the tone. The current form is acceptable, but consider regional preferences for tone and register.",
