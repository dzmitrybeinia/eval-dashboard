      "description": "The word 'calientes' is not the standard adjective for climate or environment in Spanish from Spain; 'c√°lidos' is the correct term to describe warm or hot climates. 'Calientes' refers to something physically hot to the touch, not to environmental temperature. This affects lexical precision and naturalness.",

The heading 'Adaptaciones de los ping√ºinos en el polo' should match this usage for consistency and accuracy. Using the singular 'polo' may cause confusion about which pole is being referenced.",
