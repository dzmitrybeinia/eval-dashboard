      "description": "The phrase incorrectly uses 'de' before a proper name starting with a vowel. In French, the contraction 'de' + 'Antoine' should be 'd'Antoine' to avoid a hiatus and follow mandatory contraction rules. This is a minor orthographic error but important for correct written French.",

      "description": "The apostrophe in 'l'école' uses a straight quote instead of the French typographic apostrophe (’). While this is a minor typographic issue, using the correct apostrophe is standard in French publishing and improves the professional appearance of educational materials.",

In French educational contexts, including a French or francophone source alongside international ones would enhance cultural appropriateness and relatability for learners.",
