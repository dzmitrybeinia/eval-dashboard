      "description": "The term 'Checks and Balances' is used in English within a German-language educational context. While the concept is well-known, it is preferable to use a German equivalent such as 'Gewaltenkontrolle' or 'gegenseitige Kontrolle' for clarity and cultural appropriateness, especially in educational materials for learners. Using the English term without explanation may hinder comprehension for some students and does not align with best localization practices.",

While emojis can enhance engagement for younger audiences, their use should be carefully considered based on the target age group and educational context. If the lesson is intended for a formal or older audience, it is recommended to remove the emoji to maintain a professional tone.",
