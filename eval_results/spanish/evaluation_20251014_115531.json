In Spanish, the standard and widely accepted acronym is 'EEI' for 'Estación Espacial Internacional.' Using 'ISS' in Spanish educational content may confuse learners and does not align with localization best practices. The correction ensures consistency with Spanish-language scientific terminology.",
