      "description": "The sentence is missing the preposition 'a' before 'todos', which is required for correct grammatical structure in Brazilian Portuguese. The verb 'atender' in this context requires the preposition to indicate the indirect object. This is a common error and should be corrected for proper agreement and clarity.",

      "description": "The phrase 'sentimentos magoados' is not idiomatic in Brazilian Portuguese. The more natural and precise term is 'm√°goas', which directly refers to hurt feelings. This correction improves lexical precision and naturalness.",
