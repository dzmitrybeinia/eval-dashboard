# Lesson name: Introduction to Coding Basics

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Variables can only store numbers and cannot hold text or boolean values.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Variables are versatile and can store not only numerical data but also text and boolean values. This flexibility is what allows programs to handle a variety of data types and perform different operations.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** A variable storing the number of items in a shopping cart is an example of a string.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
The number of items in a shopping cart would be represented by an integer, as it is a countable value, not a textual description.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** In the programming language discussed, 'username' and 'UserName' are considered identical.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In most programming languages, case sensitivity is an important aspect of syntax. This means that 'username' and 'UserName' would be treated as separate identifiers, with 'UserName' being recognized as a different variable than 'username'. This distinction is essential to understand as it affects how variables are referenced and manipulated within code.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** In real-world applications, variables are only used for storing numerical data like prices and discounts.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Variables hold a wide range of data types, not limited to numerical. They can store text, dates, and other data types, making them versatile tools in programming.


## Question 5: YesNo

**Statement:** In coding, using the same variable name for different data types is a common practice to avoid confusion.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In programming, each variable should have a unique name that reflects the data it holds, and it's not common practice to reuse variable names. This helps maintain clarity and avoids errors in your code.
