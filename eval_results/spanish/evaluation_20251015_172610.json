      "description": "The term 'lado' is not the most precise for describing the edge of a cube in Spain's mathematical terminology. The correct term is 'arista', which refers specifically to the edge of a three-dimensional figure. Using 'arista' improves technical accuracy and aligns with standard educational language in Spain.",

      "description": "The use of the superscript '²' may not display correctly in all educational platforms or printed materials. In Spain, it is common to use the caret '^' for exponentiation in digital and textbook contexts when superscript formatting is unavailable. This ensures clarity and accessibility for all learners.",
