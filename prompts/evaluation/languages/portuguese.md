## LANGUAGE FOCUS: Portuguese (Linguistic Accuracy)

Focus on objective Portuguese linguistic rules. Assume Brazilian Portuguese as the standard unless otherwise specified.

## SPECIFIC LINGUISTIC CHECKPOINTS

### Grammar & Morphology
- **Verb Conjugation**: Pay close attention to correct endings for all tenses, especially the subjunctive mood (`subjuntivo`/`conjuntivo`), which is frequently used.
- **Ser vs. Estar**: Ensure the correct verb is used for permanent characteristics (`ser`) versus temporary states or locations (`estar`).
- **Gender & Number Agreement (Concordância)**: Adjectives, articles, and pronouns must agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify.
- **Contractions & Crase**: Verify the correct formation of mandatory contractions (`de+o=do`, `em+a=na`). Pay special attention to the correct use of the `crase` (`à`), which is a common source of errors.

### Spelling & Orthography
- **Accent Marks (Acentuação)**: Check for mandatory accent marks (`´`, `^`, `~`) which indicate correct pronunciation and stress, and can differentiate words.
- **Cedilla and Consonant Sounds**: Ensure correct use of the cedilla (`ç` - only before a, o, u) and proper spelling for sounds represented by multiple letter combinations (e.g., `s`/`z`/`ss`/`ç`, `ch`/`x`, `g`/`j`).
