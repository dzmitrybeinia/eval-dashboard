# Lesson name: Introduction to Simple Machines

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Simple machines can create energy that is not originally present in the system.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Simple machines, such as levers, pulleys, and inclined planes, are designed to make work easier by altering the magnitude or direction of force applied. They do not generate energy; instead, they redistribute the energy already present in the system.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** A screw is a type of simple machine that can change the direction of a force.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
Screws are indeed one of the six classic simple machines. They are specifically designed to convert rotational motion into linear motion, which can be used to lift or hold objects. This characteristic distinguishes them from other simple machines like levers and pulleys, which primarily amplify force or speed.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** A lever can move a load without any force being applied.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
This statement is incorrect because a lever requires an input of force at one end to move a load at the other. The principle of a lever is based on the concept of mechanical advantage, which is achieved by using a fulcrum to multiply the force applied.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** A pulley can make it easier to lift a heavy object by changing the direction of the force applied.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
Pulleys are designed to alter the force required to lift weights by redirecting the force applied, which can reduce the amount of force necessary to move an object vertically.


## Question 5: YesNo

**Statement:** The wheel and axle system requires a constant force to keep the object moving.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In the wheel and axle system, once the initial force is applied to start the motion, the object continues to move with less effort due to the reduction of friction. This is a principle of mechanical advantage where the effort required to move an object is reduced.


## Question 6: YesNo

**Statement:** An inclined plane requires more force to move an object upward than lifting it straight.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
The inclined plane is designed to reduce the effort needed to elevate an object. By distributing the force over a longer distance, less force is required at any given moment compared to lifting the object vertically, making the statement false.


## Question 7: YesNo

**Statement:** A wedge's efficiency decreases as the angle between its sides becomes narrower.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
The efficiency of a wedge actually increases with a narrower angle between its sides, as it allows the force applied to be distributed over a smaller area, resulting in greater pressure on the material it's being driven into.


## Question 8: YesNo

**Statement:** Turning a screw on a jar lid requires more energy than turning one on a corkscrew.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
The energy required to turn a screw is determined by the amount of force and the distance over which it is applied. Both jar lids and corkscrews have screws that convert rotational force into linear force, but the resistance and required effort can vary depending on the design and purpose of the screw. Typically, a corkscrew is designed to exert more force to pull out a cork, which may require more energy compared to simply opening a jar lid.


## Question 9: YesNo

**Statement:** Simple machines always require human intervention to function effectively.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Simple machines are designed to make tasks easier by reducing the amount of force needed. They do not always require human intervention to function; for instance, a ramp can move an object with minimal effort without continuous human push.
