# Lesson name: Understanding Basic Algebra: Variables, Expressions, and Simple Equations

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Variables can only represent numbers, not letters or symbols.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Variables are indeed represented by letters or symbols, commonly used to denote unknown or changeable values, and not limited to just numbers.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** In an algebraic expression, a variable can only be a letter like 'x' or 'y'.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Variables in algebra can be letters or symbols, and sometimes numbers. The statement is false because variables can also take other forms such as Greek letters or Roman numerals, depending on the context.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** If you want to find the value of a variable in the equation x + 5 = 12, you should subtract 5 from both sides.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
By performing the inverse operation to the constant added to the variable, you undo the addition and isolate the variable on one side of the equation.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** In algebra, variables are always represented by letters and never numbers or symbols.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Variables in algebra can be represented by letters, numbers, or symbols, depending on the context and the preference of the mathematician. Often, numbers are used to represent constants, while letters or symbols denote variables.


## Question 5: YesNo

**Statement:** In algebra, an expression can be simplified by choosing a value for the variable to make it equal to zero.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
An expression cannot be simplified to zero by simply choosing a value for the variable. Simplification involves combining like terms or using operations to reduce complexity, not making the expression equal to zero.
