      "description": "The phrase 'pesos y contrapesos' is a literal translation of 'checks and balances' and is not the standard terminology used in Spain for this governmental concept. The correct and widely accepted term in Spanish (Spain) is 'controles y equilibrios'. Using the literal translation may cause confusion or sound unnatural to native speakers. The rest of the sentence is clear and accurate.",
