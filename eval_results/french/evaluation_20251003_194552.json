      "description": "The term 'gâteaux de riz' is vague and not the standard way to refer to the traditional food associated with the Lunar New Year in China. The culturally and linguistically accurate term is 'gâteaux de riz gluant' (or 'niangao'). This correction improves both lexical precision and cultural relevance.",
