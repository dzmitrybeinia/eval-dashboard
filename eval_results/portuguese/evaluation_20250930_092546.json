      "description": "The phrase 'Necess√°rio?' lacks the verb '√©', which is needed for parallel structure and grammatical correctness in Portuguese. All questions should start with '√â' to maintain consistency and clarity. This omission affects the grammatical accuracy and the natural flow of the list of questions.",

While emojis can make content more engaging for younger audiences, their inclusion should be carefully considered based on the target audience and platform. If the lesson is intended for a formal or adult audience, it is advisable to remove or replace emojis with more neutral visual elements.",
