      "description": "Although the sentence is linguistically correct, the use of 'l√°pis' is appropriate and properly accented. No orthographic errors are present. However, the example could be improved for clarity by specifying that the mark made by the pencil is a representation of a point, not an actual geometric point, but this is a minor stylistic suggestion and does not constitute an error.",

      "description": "The use of the abacus emoji (üßÆ) is not standard in formal educational content in Brazilian Portuguese and may be perceived as informal or distracting in some contexts. Removing the emoji ensures a more neutral and professional tone appropriate for educational materials.",
