## SPECIFIC LINGUISTIC CHECKPOINTS

### Grammar & Morphology
- **Particles (助詞 - joshi)**: This is critical. Verify the correct usage of particles like `は`, `が`, `を`, `に`, `へ`, `で`, `と`, `の` as they define the grammatical function of words.
- **Verb Conjugation (動詞の活用)**: Check for correct verb endings corresponding to tense (past/non-past), politeness (`-masu` form vs. plain form), and other forms (passive, causative, potential).
- **Counters (助数詞 - josuushi)**: Ensure the correct counter word is used for the object being counted (e.g., `本` for long objects, `枚` for flat objects, `人` for people).

### Writing System & Orthography
- **Kanji/Kana Usage**: Verify the correct choice of Kanji for the intended meaning. Ensure Katakana is used for loanwords and Hiragana for grammatical elements (`okurigana`) and native words.
- **Okurigana (送り仮名)**: Check that the Hiragana endings on verbs and adjectives are correct.
- **Punctuation (句読点)**: Ensure the use of Japanese-specific punctuation, such as the full-width comma (`、`) and period (`。`).
- **Long Vowels**: Verify that long vowels in Katakana are correctly represented (e.g., `コンピューター` not `コンピュタ`).
