# Lesson name: Understanding Basic Algebra: Variables, Expressions, and Equations

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** The letter 'z' always stands for the number of oranges you eat.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
The letter 'z' is not fixed to represent the number of oranges consumed; it is simply a placeholder for an unknown value that can be assigned to any quantity or variable in algebraic expressions.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** The expression '4z - 9' can be interpreted as 'four times z, less nine'.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
Algebraic expressions use variables and operations to describe relationships or calculations. They are structured as combinations of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations. The statement accurately conveys the meaning of the given expression, capturing the essence of how expressions are constructed and understood.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** An equation always includes an equal sign and is used to determine unknown values.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
In mathematics, an equation is a fundamental concept that involves two expressions separated by an equal sign, indicating they hold the same value. This principle is crucial in algebra for solving unknown quantities, which are typically represented by variables.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** In simplifying algebraic expressions, it is always necessary to multiply the coefficients of like terms.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
While combining like terms, we add or subtract coefficients, but multiplication of coefficients isn't a standard step for simplification. Instead, we look for terms that can be combined by matching their variable parts.


## Question 5: YesNo

**Statement:** If each week you add $10 to your savings, the total amount saved after 'n' weeks can be expressed as 10n.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
This statement is true because it accurately describes how a simple algebraic expression can be used to model a real-world situation. By using 'n' as the variable representing the number of weeks, you can calculate your savings at any given time by multiplying it by 10.


## Question 6: YesNo

**Statement:** In algebra, every expression must contain an equal sign to be considered valid.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Expressions in algebra consist of variables, numbers, and operations, and they do not require an equal sign to be valid. Equations are the ones that include an equal sign, used to find the value of unknowns.
