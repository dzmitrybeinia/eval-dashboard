## SPECIFIC LINGUISTIC CHECKPOINTS

### Grammar & Morphology
- **Noun Cases**: Verify correct declension of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns across all six cases (Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, Instrumental, Prepositional).
- **Verb Aspect**: Ensure the correct aspect (perfective/imperfective) is used to distinguish completed actions from ongoing or habitual ones (e.g., `сделать` vs. `делать`).
- **Verbs of Motion**: Check for correct usage of unidirectional vs. multidirectional verbs (`идти` vs. `ходить`, `ехать` vs. `ездить`), including prefixed forms.
- **Verb Conjugation**: Pay attention to the two main conjugation patterns and exceptions.

### Spelling & Orthography
- **`тся` vs. `ться`**: Verify the correct ending for reflexive verbs in the 3rd person vs. the infinitive form.
- **Unstressed Vowels**: Check for common spelling errors in unstressed positions (e.g., 'о'/'а').
- **Punctuation**: Russian has strict comma rules for subordinate clauses, participial phrases, and direct speech. Verify their correct application.
