# Spanish Language-Specific Instructions

## LANGUAGE FOCUS: Spanish (Linguistic Accuracy) - Spain Only

Focus on objective Spanish linguistic rules for Peninsular Spanish (España).

**IMPORTANT**: Check content against Spanish standards used in SPAIN. Do NOT flag vocabulary or terminology differences from Latin American Spanish as errors (e.g., "ordenador" vs "computadora", "patatas" vs "papas" are both correct - use Spain variants).

## SPECIFIC LINGUISTIC CHECKPOINTS

### Grammar & Morphology
- **Subjunctive Mood**: Verify correct usage of subjunctive in dependent clauses, commands, and expressions of doubt.
- **Ser vs. Estar**: Ensure the correct verb is used for permanent vs. temporary states.
- **Gender & Number Agreement**: Adjectives, articles, and pronouns must agree with the noun's gender and number.
- **Por vs. Para**: Check for correct preposition usage based on context (e.g., cause, purpose, duration).

### Spelling & Orthography
- **Accent Marks (Tildes)**: Critical for meaning and pronunciation (e.g., "sí" vs "si", "él" vs "el"). Ensure they are present where required.
- **Punctuation**: Check for correct use of opening question/exclamation marks (`¿` and `¡`).
- **Letter-Sound Rules**: Verify correct spelling for 'c'/'z'/'s', 'g'/'j', 'b'/'v'.
