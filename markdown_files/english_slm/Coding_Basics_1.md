# Lesson name: Introduction to Coding Basics: Understanding Variables, Data Types, and Basic Syntax in Python

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** In Python, variable names can contain spaces and start with a number.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In Python, variable names must start with a letter or an underscore, and cannot contain spaces. They cannot begin with a number.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** In Python, the variable 'temperature' can be assigned a value of 'Hello' without any errors.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In Python, a variable named 'temperature' is expected to hold a number representing a measurement like degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, not a string. Attempting to assign a string to 'temperature' would result in a TypeError since Python is trying to interpret 'Hello' as a numerical value.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** In Python, the `==` operator is used to assign values to variables.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In Python, the `=` operator is used for assignment, not the `==` operator. The `==` operator is used to compare the equality of two values.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** In Python, a variable's data type can be changed at runtime without any errors.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
While Python is a dynamically typed language, and variables are not fixed to a single data type, changing a variable's data type at runtime can cause errors. Python variables are flexible, but they must be used appropriately according to their assigned data type.
