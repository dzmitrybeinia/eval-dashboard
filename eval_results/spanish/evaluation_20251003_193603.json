      "description": "The term 'tirones gravitatorios' is not standard in Spanish scientific discourse and may cause confusion. The correct and widely accepted term is 'asistencias gravitacionales' or 'maniobras de asistencia gravitacional', which refers to gravitational slingshot maneuvers used in space travel. This correction improves both technical accuracy and clarity.",

      "correction": "velocidad orbital",
      "description": "The feedback incorrectly states that a spacecraft needs 'velocidad de escape' to maintain a stable orbit. 'Velocidad de escape' refers to the speed required to break free from a planet's gravity, not to remain in orbit. The correct term is 'velocidad orbital', which is the speed needed to stay in orbit around a planet or star. This is a semantic error that could mislead learners about orbital mechanics.",

      "description": "The summary refers to 'la Ley de Newton' without specifying which law, which may be ambiguous for learners. Since the lesson consistently references the third law of Newton, it is clearer and more educational to specify 'la tercera ley de Newton' for consistency and precision.",
