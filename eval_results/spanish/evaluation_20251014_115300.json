      "description": "The correct spelling in Spanish for the desert is 'Sáhara' with an accent on the first 'a'. This is the locally accepted form and aligns with the Real Academia Española. Using 'Sahara' without the accent is an anglicism and does not conform to Spanish orthographic standards. This affects both linguistic accuracy and cultural appropriateness.",
