      "description": "The acronym 'VEM CAJUM' is presented as a mnemonic for remembering the planets in the solar system. However, this is not a standard or widely recognized mnemonic in Brazilian Portuguese educational contexts. The most common mnemonic for the planets is 'Minha Vó Tem Muitas Joias Só Usa No Pescoço' or 'VEM CAVEM' (for the order: Vênus, Terra, Marte, Júpiter, Saturno, Urano, Netuno). Using a nonstandard or invented acronym may confuse learners and reduce the effectiveness of the example. It is important to use culturally and educationally accepted mnemonics to ensure clarity and relatability.",
