This correction improves lexical precision and aligns with common usage in educational contexts.",

This is standard for translated works, but for consistency and clarity, it is recommended to specify if the book is a translation and, if possible, reference the Spanish edition or translator to better localize the example for Spanish-speaking learners.",
