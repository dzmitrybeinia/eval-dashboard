# Lesson name: Introduction to Coding Basics: Understanding Algorithms, Variables, and Simple Programming Constructs

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** An algorithm is a random set of instructions that computers can't follow.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
An algorithm is actually a well-defined set of instructions that computers follow to perform a task. They are designed to be clear, logical, and executable by a computer program.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** Variables are immutable containers that store data; they cannot be changed once set.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Variables are actually mutable containers in programming; they can store data and are designed to be changed as needed throughout the execution of a program.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** Loops in programming are used to execute a block of code multiple times without manual repetition.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
Loops are fundamental programming structures that automate repetitive tasks. This is akin to having a machine that repeats the same task over and over again, without needing to manually start and stop each time.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** Variables can only store numerical data.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Variables in programming are not limited to numerical data; they can store different types of data, such as strings, booleans, and other data types depending on the language.
