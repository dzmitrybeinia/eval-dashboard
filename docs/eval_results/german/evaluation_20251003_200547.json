The correct term is 'Amun-Osiris' if referring to a syncretic deity, but in the context of Egyptian religion, Osiris and Amun are distinct gods. The sentence should clarify the role of the Pharao as the representative of the gods, typically Ra or Osiris, not 'Akumu-Osiris'. This lexical error could mislead learners about Egyptian mythology.",
