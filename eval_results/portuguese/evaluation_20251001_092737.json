      "description": "The term 'Limerique' is a direct adaptation of the English 'limerick' and is not widely accepted or standard in Brazilian Portuguese. The more common and accepted term is 'limerique', but even this is rare; most Brazilian sources use 'limerique' as a loanword. However, the spelling 'limerique' is correct in this context, so no correction is needed. This is a minor lexical note for awareness.",

      "correction": "amém!",
      "description": "The use of 'amém!' at the end of the limerick is orthographically correct, but its inclusion in a humorous context may be seen as slightly incongruent with the tone of the rest of the poem. However, this is not a linguistic error, but rather a stylistic choice. No correction is needed, but educators should be aware of the potential for mixed tone.",

      "correction": "Que sonhou estar em um jardim.",
      "description": "The phrase 'Que sonhou estar com seu harém.' may be culturally inappropriate for some audiences, especially in educational contexts for younger students, as it references a 'harem,' which can be considered sensitive or inappropriate. Replacing it with a more neutral and culturally appropriate scenario, such as 'em um jardim' (in a garden), maintains the rhyme and humor without potential cultural insensitivity.",
