      "description": "The phrase 'Son de Reverde' is a lexical error and does not correspond to any known speech or concept associated with Martin Luther King Jr. The intended reference is to his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech, which in Spanish is commonly referred to as 'Sueño de libertad' or 'Tengo un sueño'. This error affects comprehension and accuracy, as it misrepresents a key historical event and could confuse learners.",

      "description": "The term 'Ley de Derechos Electorales de 1965' is not the standard or widely accepted name for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in Spanish. The correct and commonly used term is 'Ley de Derecho al Voto de 1965'. Using the standard terminology ensures consistency and clarity for Spanish-speaking audiences, especially in educational contexts.",
