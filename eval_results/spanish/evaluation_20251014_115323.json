      "description": "The original Spanish title uses an unnatural word order that does not follow standard syntactic patterns. In Spanish, the subject ('el cerebro') should precede the object ('las decisiones') for clarity and naturalness. The corrected version improves readability and aligns with standard Spanish syntax. No other linguistic or localization issues are present in this text.",

      "description": "The term 'el estriado' is incomplete and may cause confusion for Spanish-speaking learners, as the standard anatomical term is 'el cuerpo estriado'. Using the full term ensures clarity and aligns with scientific terminology commonly used in Spanish educational contexts. No linguistic errors are present, but the terminology should be corrected for professional and educational accuracy.",
