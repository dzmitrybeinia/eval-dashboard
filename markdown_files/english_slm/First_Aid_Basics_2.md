# Lesson name: First Aid Basics: Responding to Common Emergencies

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Second-degree burns are the least severe and only affect the outer layer of skin.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Second-degree burns are actually more severe than first-degree burns because they affect deeper skin layers, causing blisters and swelling, not just the outer layer.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** If a person is choking, they can still breathe and talk without any difficulty.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
When an individual is choking, it typically hinders their ability to breathe or speak. The presence of difficulty in speaking or clutching at the throat are indicators that the airway is obstructed. Encouraging coughing is a primary response to such a situation, as effective coughing can dislodge the obstructing item.
