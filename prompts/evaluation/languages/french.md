## SPECIFIC LINGUISTIC CHECKPOINTS

### Grammar & Morphology
- **Verb Conjugation**: Pay close attention to tenses like `passé composé` (with `avoir`/`être`), `imparfait`, and `subjonctif`.
- **Gender & Number Agreement**: Adjectives, articles, and past participles must agree with the subject/object.
- **Pronoun Placement**: Verify the correct order of object pronouns (e.g., "le lui", "y en") especially in relation to the verb.
- **Negation**: Ensure correct structure of complex negations (e.g., `ne ... pas`, `ne ... que`, `ne ... jamais`).

### Spelling & Orthography
- **Accent Marks**: Check for correct usage of `é` (aigu), `è` (grave), `â` (circonflexe), `ç` (cédille), and `ë` (tréma).
- **Contractions**: Ensure mandatory contractions are made (e.g., "le + arbre" -> "l'arbre", "de + les" -> "des").
- **Hyphenation**: Verify correct hyphen usage in compound nouns and verb-pronoun inversions.
