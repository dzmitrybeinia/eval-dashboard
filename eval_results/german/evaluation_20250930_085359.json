      "description": "The phrase 'Mutter der BÃ¼rgerrechtsbewegung' is a direct translation of 'Mother of the Civil Rights Movement.' In German educational and historical contexts, such honorifics are typically presented in quotation marks to indicate their status as a title or nickname, especially when referencing well-known figures like Rosa Parks. Adding quotation marks improves clarity and aligns with German conventions for nicknames and honorifics.",

      "description": "The organization name 'Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)' is presented in English within a German text. While it is common to retain official organization names in their original language, for educational clarity in German, it is preferable to add a brief German explanation or translation in parentheses, such as '(Studentischer Ausschuss fÃ¼r gewaltfreie Koordination)'. This helps learners understand the reference and maintains linguistic precision.",

      "description": "The case name 'Brown v. Board of Education (1954)' is presented in the American legal format. In German educational materials, it is common to briefly explain the meaning of 'v.' (versus) for clarity, such as 'Brown gegen Board of Education (1954)'. This ensures learners unfamiliar with English legal abbreviations understand the reference.",

Emojis are generally avoided in formal contexts to maintain professionalism and clarity. Removing the emoji aligns the style with German educational norms.",
