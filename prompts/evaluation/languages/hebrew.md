# LANGUAGE FOCUS: Hebrew (עברית)

## HEBREW-SPECIFIC EVALUATION CRITERIA

### Script and Orthography
- **Right-to-Left Script**: Ensure RTL direction for text, punctuation, and embedded numerals
- **Final Forms**: Verify final consonants (ך, ם, ן, ף, ץ) appear only at word endings
- **Niqqud Usage**: Educational content may require diacritics; include them consistently or omit entirely
- **Geresh/Gershayim**: Use correctly for abbreviations (׳) and acronyms (״)
- **Transliteration**: When transliterating foreign names, apply standard Israeli spelling conventions

### Morphology and Grammar
- **Root-and-Pattern System**: Check verb binyanim for correct conjugation across tense, person, gender, and number
- **Construct State (סמיכות)**: Ensure proper noun-noun combinations and agreement
- **Prepositions with Pronoun Suffixes**: Validate forms like איתי/איתך/אִתּוֹ
- **Gender Agreement**: Adjectives, numerals, and verbs must agree in gender and number
- **Definiteness**: Confirm correct use of the definite article ה־ and its assimilation rules

### Syntax and Word Order
- **Standard SVO Order**: Maintain clarity while allowing topicalization when stylistically appropriate
- **Subordination**: Ensure conjunctions (ש-, כי, כדי) introduce clauses with proper tense and agreement
- **Question Formation**: Verify interrogatives (מה, איך, מדוע) and rising intonation markers (האם) when needed
- **Negation**: Distinguish between לא (present/future) and אין/אין/איננו structures

### Lexical and Semantic Issues
- **Register**: Prefer Modern Hebrew suitable for educational contexts; avoid slang unless explained
- **Loanwords vs. Hebrew Equivalents**: Use Academy of the Hebrew Language recommendations where relevant
- **Homographs**: Pay attention to context-sensitive meanings, especially without niqqud
- **Terminology Consistency**: Maintain uniform translations for technical vocabulary across the material

### Cultural and Localization Aspects
- **Contextual Relevance**: Examples should resonate with Israeli or Hebrew-speaking learners
- **Calendrical References**: Gregorian dates are common; include Hebrew calendar equivalents when context demands
- **Measurement Units**: Metric system default; include imperial equivalents only when necessary
- **Names and Places**: Ensure accurate Hebrew spellings for people, cities, and institutions

### Common Error Patterns to Check
- **Mixing Scripts**: Avoid Latin characters in Hebrew words unless transliterating intentionally
- **Wrong Final Letters**: Detect misuse of ן/נ, ף/פ, ץ/צ, ם/מ, ך/כ
- **Confusing Similar Letters**: Watch for interchange of א/ע, ה/ח, or ט/ת in unvocalized text
- **Incorrect Prepositions**: Verify fixed expressions (לדבר על, להקשיב ל) use correct prepositions
- **Hyphenation**: Ensure maqaf (־) used properly in compound terms and numbers

## EVALUATION SUBCATEGORIES

### Linguistic Issues:
- **Grammar**: Verb patterns, agreement, construct state accuracy

### Localization Issues:
- **Cultural References**: Examples misaligned with Hebrew-speaking learners
- **Formatting**: Mixed-direction text that breaks readability or punctuation norms
