# Lesson name: Understanding the States of Matter: Solid, Liquid, Gas, and Plasma

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** In a plasma state, the particles are so closely packed that they have a definite shape and volume.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Plasma is actually a high-energy state of matter where particles are ionized and not closely packed. This state of matter is found in stars and during lightning, where particles have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** In solids, particles vibrate but maintain a fixed volume.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
The particles in a solid are closely packed together and vibrate in place, which gives solids their definite shape and volume.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** When water turns into steam, it loses energy.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In reality, water turns into steam by gaining energy, not losing it. This added energy allows the water molecules to move apart and spread out, becoming a gas.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** When water is heated, it eventually turns into steam.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
Heating water increases the kinetic energy of its molecules, leading to a phase transition from liquid to gas, which we observe as steam. This is an example of energy addition causing matter to change states.


## Question 5: YesNo

**Statement:** Plasma is the most common state of matter on Earth.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In reality, the most common state of matter on Earth is not plasma but solid or liquid. Plasma is found naturally only in extremely high temperatures, such as in stars and lightning. On Earth, we encounter solids like rocks and liquids like water in our daily lives.
