      "description": "The use of 'rhythm & blues' in French educational content is not standard orthography. The ampersand ('&') is an English convention and should be replaced with 'and' or, more appropriately in French, 'et'. However, 'rhythm and blues' is commonly used as a loanword in French, but the ampersand is not standard in formal or educational writing. For clarity and consistency, 'rhythm and blues' should be used instead of 'rhythm & blues'.",

This reflects common usage in French music discourse and aligns with how the genre is typically referenced in French educational and cultural materials.",
