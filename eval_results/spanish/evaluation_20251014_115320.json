      "description": "The phrase 'Día de la Bastilla' is a direct translation of 'Bastille Day' but is not the most commonly used term in Spanish. The more accurate and culturally recognized term is 'Día de la Toma de la Bastilla', which refers specifically to the historical event celebrated in France.
