# Lesson name: Introduction to Cell Parts

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Organelles are the biological machines that exclusively function within animal cells.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Organelles are specialized structures within both plant and animal cells, with some being unique to each type, not exclusively animal cells.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** The nucleus is responsible for producing cellular energy through the process of cellular respiration.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
The nucleus is actually the cell's control center, containing genetic material and managing growth and protein synthesis, not energy production. Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria, not the nucleus.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** Mitochondria are solely responsible for breaking down glucose into ATP.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
While mitochondria are crucial for ATP production, glucose breakdown begins in the cytoplasm with glycolysis. Mitochondria further process the products of glycolysis in the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** Ribosomes are the primary site for lipid synthesis within the cell.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Ribosomes are specifically responsible for protein synthesis, not lipid synthesis. Lipid synthesis occurs in different parts of the cell, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.


## Question 5: YesNo

**Statement:** Animal cells contain centrioles that are not found in plant cells.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
Animal cells possess centrioles, which play a role in cell division by organizing the microtubules in the centrosome during mitosis. This organelle is absent in plant cells, where other structures facilitate cell division and structural integrity.


## Question 6: YesNo

**Statement:** Mitochondria are responsible for creating oxygen within our cells.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Mitochondria are actually the powerhouses of the cell, generating ATP through cellular respiration, not creating oxygen. The process of photosynthesis, where oxygen is produced, occurs in chloroplasts within plant cells.
