# Lesson name: Animal Adaptations and Natural Selection

## Question 1: YesNo

**Statement:** Behavioral adaptations are physical changes an animal undergoes to better survive in its environment.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Behavioral adaptations refer to actions or behaviors, not physical changes. For instance, birds migrating to escape cold weather is a behavioral adaptation, not a physical one.


## Question 2: YesNo

**Statement:** An animal's long neck is an example of a physical adaptation for survival.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
The statement is accurate as it refers to a specialized body part, such as a giraffe's neck, which is an adaptation that enables the animal to access food sources unavailable to others, thus enhancing its survival.


## Question 3: YesNo

**Statement:** Monarch butterflies hibernate to escape the cold and find food sources.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
Monarch butterflies do not hibernate. Instead, they migrate to escape the cold and find food sources. Hibernation is a behavioral adaptation used by animals like bears to conserve energy during winter.


## Question 4: YesNo

**Statement:** Organisms with beneficial traits have a higher chance of surviving and passing these traits to their offspring.

**Answer:** True

**Feedback:**
This statement is aligned with the key point that traits improving survival and reproduction are favored by natural selection, leading to their prevalence within a population.


## Question 5: YesNo

**Statement:** Animal populations that do not exhibit beneficial adaptations will likely thrive in their environment.

**Answer:** False

**Feedback:**
In the context of natural selection, animal populations that lack adaptations may struggle to survive or reproduce. Adaptations are crucial for coping with environmental challenges. Therefore, the survival and prosperity of these populations depend on their ability to develop beneficial traits.
